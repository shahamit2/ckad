******************************************************
1. Objective
- Learn about monitoring solution.

******************************************************
2. About Monitoring
- Monitoring helps with
  - How many nodes are healthy?
  - How much resources are consumed on nodes?
  - How much resources are consumed by pods?
- K8S does not come with Monitoring solution.
- Several solutions available in market.
  - Elastics Stack
  - Datadog
  - Prometheus
  - Dynatrace
  - Metrics Server


******************************************************
3. About Metrics Server
- Limited feature solution
- In memory solution
  - Does not store metrics on disk
  - Historical performance data not available
- Architecture
  - Kubelet has sub component cAdvisor
    - cAdvisor
      - Responsible for retrieving performance metrics from nodes and pods
      - Make them available to metrics server

- Note
  - CKAD exam has minimal implemented solution.

******************************************************
4. Metrics Server Deployment
- Below URL provides instructions to implement.
  - https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server

- Run below commands to install metrics server
vagrant ssh kbs1
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

- Run below command to disable TLS.
kubectl edit deployments.app -n kube-system metrics-server
# Add below line in containers.args section
- --kubelet-insecure-tls
# ^ Add line after "- --kubelet-use-node-status-port"

- Run command to observe metrics-server Pods are up and running.
kubectl get pods -n kube-system

******************************************************
5. Get Metrics
- Run below commands to get metrics for Nodes and Pods
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods
